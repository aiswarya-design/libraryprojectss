    The technical feasibility study is a study of function, performances and constraints
    and improves the ability to create an acceptable system. Technical feasibility is frequently
    the most difficult are to achieve at the stage of product engineering process.
    Considering that are normally associated with the technical feasibility include
•	Development risk
•	Resource availability
        Technical feasibility centers around the computer system and to
    what extent it can support the user requirements. During analysis, the assessment of
    the technical feasibility was made based on outline design of the system requirements in
    terms of inputs, outputs, files, programs, etc.
In this project, Smart Content Management System, a web-based application
    which runs on any operating system supported with HTML5 browser and internet connectivity.
    Almost all operating systems such as Windows XP, Windows 7,
    Windows 8 and free software such as Ubuntu etc. support this project.
    The hardware requirement for the project is minimal and affordable.
    The project does not need any other extra software for smooth working.
    The Smart Content Management System proves to be technically feasible.
